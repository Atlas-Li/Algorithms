Given an integer ```x```, return ```true``` if ```x``` is a palindrome, and ```false``` otherwise.

## Example 1:
```bash
Input: x = 121
Output: true
Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.
```

## Example 2:
```bash
Input: x = -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
```

## Example 3:
```bash
Input: x = 10
Output: false
Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
```

## Constraints:
```bash
-2^31 <= x <= 2^31 - 1
```
